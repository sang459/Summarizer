Chapter 3 The Interior Decorator Fallacy that one of the available assets in the model was riskless turned out to have interesting consequences. . I n 1961, one of our friends, a woman in her early 40s, came into a modest inheritance and asked me to manage a small port- folio for her. She was married to a clergyman, a man with a logical mind and a strong dose of intellectual curiosity. We used to joke about his writing my market letters and my delivering his ser- mons.. He enjoyed his profession, but he had no illusions about his earnings prospects. His wife's inheritance was a real windfall, and they wanted it invested for maximum income. Shortly after they became clients, my investment counseling firm began to recommend a strategy based on demographics. We called it 'investing in the puberty boom." We bought heavy posi- tions in Gillette and Tampax (then a highly controversial stock to own, and awkward even to suggest to a client of either sex), and in Georgia Pacific Lumber for the new homes being built for growing families. For reasons unrelated to demography, we were also accumulating large holdings of IBM, because of our convic- tions about the dynamic future for computers. I had a hard time deciding whether our new clients should par- ticipate in what looked like-and turned out to be an exciting investment program. Whenever I called them with a suggestion, they inevitably asked, "Does it pay a good dividend?" None of these companies paid a "good dividend" at that time. We wanted 61The Whole and the Parts to own them because we believed that their explosive growth would bring good dividends in the future, and because the value of the stocks would rise as dividends rose. Even though these stocks seemed inappropriate for people who were investing for current income, I was reluctant to deny this couple the opportunity to benefit from what we considered to be the best idea we had had in a long time. So I took the plunge and called them to make my recommendation. It took a lot of arm- twisting, but we finally bought them small positions in each of the four stocks. No one was sorry afterward. I had just the opposite problem with some of our more aggres- sive clients. I can still hear the young business executive who told me on his first visit that "The one thing I can't stand is more income." In the mid-1950s, we thought the electric utilities were irresistible, with safe and growing dividends that yielded at least double what an investor could earn on high-grade bonds. My cli- ent's distaste for paying taxes on current income made me hesi- tate for a long time before I finally recommended the utilities to him. He was more stubborn than the clergyman and his wife, and he missed out on some handsome capital gains as a result. Although our philosophy is now more widely accepted than it was in the 1960s, our willingness to recommend growth stocks to conservative investors and income stocks to aggressive inves- tors was an unorthodox approach for its time. Rejecting the gos- pel of the tailor-made approach to portfolio selection, we were motivated by the simple thought that every client was entitled to benefit from our best ideas. We could vary the character of the portfolio by buying more or less of this stock or that, or by limit- ing or expanding a client's exposure to stocks in general, but we could find no good reason why each client's list of stocks had to be unique. 2 When I say that our approach is no longer regarded as unortho- dox, I do not mean to suggest that it is now the only method. The old way is still in use, especially when the clients are individual investors, endowment funds, or foundations, whose particular circumstances and tax positions differ much more widely than is the case with pension funds. Managers responsible for the portfolio of an elderly widow, for example, emphasize income and avoid taking risks. A widow who was obliged to "eat principal," even when that principal included substantial capital gains, was once considered to be committing a 62The Interior Decorator Fallacy mortal sin. For many years the quintessential stock for widows and orphans was AT&T, which faithfully paid a dividend of $9, through bad times and good, from 1922 to 1958. In April 1959, the leopard changed its spots. AT&T split 2:1, increased its di- vidend 5 percent, set out to convert itself into a growth stock, and was no longer the ne plus ultra for widows. Selecting stocks for business executives on the rise is an entirely different matter. These executives are trying to build an estate and focus more on the future than on the present. Unlike the widow, they are willing and able to live with unavoidable short- term risks and variability if their portfolios are to grow in the long run. Such clients are in search of the next Xerox, as the saying goes. Managers will therefore buy them a collection of young, adventuresome companies, many of which may not be paying di- vidends at all. Richard Brealey, professor of finance at the London Business School, once described portfolio managers who use such long- established approaches as "interior decorators" who see each cli- ent as a distinct entity with unique requirements.

They view the widow's holdings in AT&T as inappropriate for the executive ea- ger to build an estate; they consider the executive's exotic stocks equally inappropriate for the widow with shorter life expectancy and with no earning power outside the portfolio. Presumably, the living-room decor of two such clients would be equally revealing about their lifestyles. Although my investment counseling organization had the right intuition about how to manage the affairs of our clients, we had never heard of Harry Markowitz or the Efficient Frontier when we were developing our methodology. Neither had the orthodox management organizations. Yet Markowitz's ideas about efficient portfolios that maximized expected return while minimizing risk were breathing mathematical precision into the practical prob- lems we were trying to solve. Even if we had mastered Markowitz's message, there was no way we could have applied it as he had designed it. A. D. Roy himself, reviewing Markowitz's book in 1959, cautioned his readers: While Dr. Markowitz warns that past experience is unlikely to be a very good guide to future performance, he gives us no clear indication of how either we, or our investment 63139 The Whole and the Parts advisers, can provide ourselves with sufficiently precise or generally agreed expectations to merit their processing in an elaborate way. Dr. Markowitz presses for a precision in the specification of both motives and of expectations which it seems unlikely that any existing investor can reasonably be expected to possess or to express coherently. 1 Consider the task that Markowitz asks the investor to perform. First, the investor has to calculate the expected returns and the covariances for all the securities under analysis. To analyze only 50 securities, as many as 1,225 separate calculations are required; by the time the universe of stocks to be analyzed reaches 2,000- not an unrealistic number for large bank trust departments or ma- jor investment advisory organizations-the calculations required reach 2,003,000. And that is only the beginning. Now the Efficient Frontier must be ferreted out from the mass of numbers already accumulated. That means that the investor must examine all possible combina- tions of the securities under consideration, rank them in order of their riskiness, and then identify those portfolios that have the highest expected return for each level of risk. This procedure is hardly an inviting prospect, even for an organization equipped with the latest computing equipment. That is not the end of the story-it is only the end of the calcu- lating part of the job. Now comes the moment to make the deci- sion that matters. The calculations may end up with many differ- ent portfolios perched on the Efficient Frontier, some with high risk, some more conservative. Which of these many portfolios should the investor select? Traditional managers who follow the interior decorator ap- proach will have an easy time of it. Managers who want both the clergyman's wife and the aggressive businessman to hold the sin- gle best combination out of all possible combinations will have a much harder time. An ingenious method of simplifying this intimidating task ap- peared in the February 1958 issue of an academic journal called The Review of Economic Studies. Titled "Liquidity Preference as Behavior Toward Risk," its author was James Tobin, Sterling Pro- fessor of Economics at Yale. Then forty years old, Tobin was 64a d LS D- S The Interior Decorator Fallacy widely recognized as an outstanding economic theorist in the field of macroeconomics, the analysis of the forces that determine the overall levels of unemployment, production, and inflation. Although investments and finance were not Tobin's main focus, the paper was a major consideration in his winning the Nobel Prize in economic sciences in 1981. Tobin is a tall, quiet man. He was born in 1918 in Champaign, Illinois. His maternal grandfather lost his entire fortune during the Depression, as president of a bank that failed. The very prototype of the scholar, Tobin has always been as interested in economic policy as in economic theory-a consequence of his having grown up during the 1930s in a family that was unshakably enthu- siastic about Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. The family's liberal views were considered highly eccentric in the home territory of what was then among the most conservative of newspapers (and the source of the Cowles family's fortune), the Chicago Tribune. In a straw poll taken in 1932 among the thirty students in his sophomore high-school.class, which consisted largely of the chil- dren of university faculty, Tobin alone voted for Roosevelt. Tobin went to Harvard under a scholarship program designed to diversify its eastern-establishment student body and graduated in 1939: At that time, most wealthy people still considered Roose- velt a traitor to his class: On the day Tobin received his degree in economics, with highest honors, the alumni celebrating their 25th reunion appeared in the commencement parade wearing only suspended barrels bearing the legend "A Harvard Man Did This to Us." Economics appealed to Tobin for two reasons. First, he is a mathematics enthusiast who considers high-school algebra "about the most exciting intellectual experience of life."² He did not realize until later how useful math would be in economics- that was a bonus-but economics attracted him because it suited his taste for logical argument. Second, and surely as important, economics offered an oppor- tunity to understand and perhaps do something about the burning issues of the Great Depression. His mother's experiences as a so- cial worker during the Depression and the failure of his grandfa- ther's bank were close-up views of problems that cried out for practical solutions. In those days, the introductory economics course at Harvard was considered too difficult for freshmen. Tobin got more than 65140 The Whole and the Parts elementary material in his sophomore year, however. Spencer Pollard, an advanced graduate student who served as his instruc- tor and as his advisor out of the classroom, gave him the opportu- nity to cut his teeth on John Maynard Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. The most influential work in economics of the twentieth century, the book had only just been published. Even the most senior members of the Harvard faculty were trying to comprehend and interpret Keynes's revolu- tionary concepts. Tobin was hooked. Keynes was made to order for him-a diffi- cult, novel theoretical structure combined with persuasive pre- scriptions for overcoming the massive unemployment of the 1930s. Tobin made his mark in economics by putting both fea- tures to good use. After two years of graduate work at Harvard, he did a brief stint of war work in Washington and then served with the Navy for the next four years as a line officer on a destroyer. He refers to those years as being "on leave" from economics.³ Tobin returned to Harvard after the war to complete work for his doctorate, which he received in 1947. In 1950, Yale made him a handsome offer that he felt he could not refuse. He went to Yale as an associate professor, was promoted to full professor in 1955, and was appointed Sterling Professor of Economics in 1957. When Harvard tried to lure him back in 1957, Tobin replied that Yale had completely won his allegiance. New Haven has been home base for the Tobin family ever since. The year 1955 was a high point in Tobin's career for another reason as well. It was in that year that the American Economic Association awarded him the John Bates Clark Medal, given annu- ally to an outstanding economist under forty years of age. That year also saw the consummation of a flirtation that had been going on for seven years. In 1948, only a year after receiving his Ph.D., Tobin had been invited to discuss a paper on statistics and economics written by Jacob Marschak, one of the stars of the Cowles Commission in Chicago. The Cowles Commission, which Tobin has described as "one of the most productive research cen- ters in history," was where Harry Markowitz would develop his ideas on portfolio selection, in part under Marschak's guidance. Tobin was flattered and put all his efforts into the task. Al- though Marschak's elegant paper was highly intricate, Tobin 66The Interior Decorator Fallacy found a conceptual flaw in it-a flaw that he describes as the kind an economist would find but a straight mathematician might not. Marschak and his colleague Koopmans, later to be a Nobel lau- reate, were impressed by Tobin's critique. A warm friendship de- veloped, and Marschak and Koopmans urged Tobin to join them in Chicago. Finally, in 1953-54, when they were looking for a new director, they invited Tobin to accept the post. He was hon- ored by the invitation, but, he recalls, "I liked Yale, and my wife and I thought it was a better place for our family." He turned them down. In 1954-1955, Koopmans spent a sabbatical year at Yale as a visiting professor. He was deeply concerned about what was hap- pening at the Cowles Commission back at Chicago. The primary focus of the work at Cowles was on the application of complex mathematical and statistical methods to the problems of econom- ics. This approach is what had fascinated Markowitz, but it was also the approach that had irked Milton Friedman at Markowitz's doctoral examination. The Chicago economics department was never completely convinced that the work being done at Cowles was "economics," but that department in turn had left Harry Mar- kowitz with a lifelong conviction that economists may not be worth their salt. In any case, the leaders of the Cowles Commission were eager to leave Chicago because of the deteriorating neighborhood in which the University was located. The area has been significantly upgraded since that time, but it was then a major obstacle to re- cruiting topflight scholars. As Alfred Cowles himself was a Yale graduate, a permanent home in New Haven seemed a fitting choice. Together, these considerations led Koopmans to negotiate the transfer of the Cowles Commission from Chicago to Yale.

Yale president Griswold wanted the organization to have a new name to go with its new location, so the Commission became the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics at Yale University, with Tobin as its director. Thus, Tobin was able to remain at Yale and to become Director of the Cowles Foundation as well. Tobin's only excursion into full-time employment outside aca- demia was a year and a half in Washington serving on John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers in 1961-62. When Tobin answered the telephone one day in December 1960 and 67The Whole and the Parts heard President-elect Kennedy's voice at the other end, he recalls saying, "I'm afraid you got the wrong guy, Mr. President: I'm an ivory-tower economist." Kennedy responded, "That's the best kind. I'll be an ivory-tower president." Tobin: "That's the best kind."" As this conversation might suggest, managing personal wealth- portfolio theory and the stock market-has never been among Tobin's primary interests. His powerful contribution to portfolio theory was a fortuitous outgrowth of his concerns over economic policy and the ravages caused by depressions and inflations. That is precisely what Keynesian theory is all about. When Keynes wrote The General Theory in the 1930s, he was particu- larly concerned about getting interest rates low enough to stimu- late a sustained revival in business activity. He predicted that the economy would be doomed to an intolerable level of unemploy- ment as long as interest rates remained too high to encourage cor- porate capital investment. The only escape from this dilemma, he insisted, was through government intervention. Keynes's emphasis on the dominating influence of interest rates on unemployment was one of the more controversial ideas intro- duced by that most controversial of economists. It was also a made-to-order problem for Tobin to tackle in his 1958. article, both because of its controversial nature and its implications for economic policy. Tobin's innovation to portfolio theory was a major simplifica- tion of Markowitz's methodology. That simplification triggered a direct attack on the interior decorator approach to portfolio management. An exploration into economic policy and the Keynesian theory of interest seems a long way from my decision to buy Gillette and Tampax for the clergyman's wife, but, though the path is circuitous, there is a direct connection between them. Keynes had argued that older economists were wrong when they espoused the established notion that interest is a reward for saving and that the interest rate is the price that equates the flow of saving with the flow of investment. People do not have to put their savings out at interest. If they choose, they can keep their savings in the form of cash, which earns no interest at all. The opposite is also true. People do not have to save in order to lend money if they happen to be holding some cash when the lending opportunities appear. The notion that saving and the management 68The Interior Decorator Fallacy of liquidity are two distinct and often unrelated decisions was one of Keynes's most important contributions to economic theory. Keynes uses the expression "Liquidity Preference" to describe the idea that investors will not part with their cash unless they perceive the reward for doing so as adequate. Interest, in other words, is not only a reward for saving; it is a reward for taking the risk of owning assets that fluctuate in value and are costly to buy and sell. Money, the basic liquid asset, cannot fluctuate in price, because it itself defines price. Moreover the cost of using money to pay for things is minimal, most often zero. If other assets shared these unique attributes, stocks and bonds and even real estate could circulate as money. Other assets do not share these attributes, however. Their future prices are uncertain, and buying and selling them is costly. All other things being equal, therefore, people pre- fer liquidity. Anticipating Markowitz's ideas, Keynes argued that investors will move from money to assets that are risky and less liquid only if they expect to earn a reward for doing so. Tobin points out that Keynes built two bizarre features into his theory of Liquidity Preference. For one thing, Keynes assumed that investors' expectations of interest rates in the future are ex- tremely slow to change: the rate of interest is a highly con- ventional, rather than a highly psychological phenomenon. . . . Any level of interest which is accepted with sufficient conviction as likely to be durable will be durable. [I]t may fluctuate for decades about a level which is chronically too high for full em- ployment."7. Although Keynes fails to provide a convincing explanation of why interest rates have to be so stable, even for decades, eco- nomic theorists tend to draw on their own experience and the history they learned at school. Keynes's memory bank in the early 1930s undoubtedly explains why he wrote that particular para- graph. For nearly sixty years, from 1861 to 1929, interest rates on high-grade long-term bonds never deviated by more than two percentage points from their average level of 4.8 percent. During Keynes's lifetime up to 1935, the year he finished writing his book at the age of 52 (he was born in 1883, the same year Karl Marx died), interest rates had averaged 4 percent a year and had varied at the extremes by only one percentage point in either di- rection. During the 1940s, the variation was less than half a per- centage point around the average level of 2.6 percent. 69The Whole and the Parts When Keynes died in 1946, he had no sense of the extraordi- nary changes that lay ahead. By 1957, as Tobin was drafting his own paper on liquidity preference, long-term interest rates were already more than 50 percent above the lows of the 1930s while short-term rates had more than tripled. Over the next thirty-three years, long-term rates would average 7.3 percent but they ranged from a high of 13.6 percent to a low of 3.8 percent. Investors' perceptions of where the rate of interest "should be" became much more variable as a result. As anxieties about volatility grad- ually dominated memories of familiar interest rate levels, the rate of interest has

developed into more of a "highly psychological" than the "highly conventional" phenomenon with which Keynes was familiar. Keynes also failed to explain why interest rates should stay where they were if investors considered the current level to be a temporary divergence from the normal, or conventional, level. Would it make sense for an investor to sell a bond at 95 when its "normal" level was 100? Keynes made clear that investors would note and would be concerned about any such divergence, but pre- cisely what would happen as a result remained obscure. Keynes's second unrealistic assumption was that each investor would choose between cash and risky assets in an either-or man- ner, holding only one asset at a time. Investors who expected in- terest rates to rise would want to hold all their capital in cash; investors who expected rates to fall would want to hold only bonds-risky because they fluctuate in price. He did not contem- plate portfolios that would consist of some combination of the two. Tobin's contribution to economic theory was to demonstrate how the Keynesian system would work even if these two arbi- trary assumptions about the behavior of interest rates and the re- sponses of investors were replaced by something more realistic. In this paper he rejects the view that people expect interest rates to fluctuate around some constant long-run normal level. That would be the case only under the highly restrictive assumption that everything in the economy is in equilibrium. Under those conditions, he points out, no one would see any need to hold interest."8 cash at all. But he adds, "So stationary a state is of very little Instead, investors recognize the truth of Mark Twain's remark 70The Interior Decorator Fallacy that forecasting is very difficult, especially when it concerns the future! They may have opinions about the outlook for interest rates, but only plungers are certain that their opinions are correct. Once uncertainty becomes part of the picture, most investors tend to avoid all-out wagers. They prefer to hold their wealth in mixed form-some cash, some risky assets. Because nobody likes unpleasant surprises, in other words, risk-averse investors hedge their bets. Tobin's paper also emphasizes that people in the real world will not wait indefinitely until the reward is high enough to persuade them to part with 100 percent of their liquidity. So investors make their decisions on some kind of continuum: they want to have at least some exposure to risky assets on the chance that things might turn out better than they expect. Diversification- an asset mix that includes both liquid and risky assets-is the most effective way to deal with outcomes that cannot be known in ad- vance. This focus on asset diversification brought Tobin to the same subject matter that had concerned Markowitz. Tobin had been working in this area before he became familiar with Markowitz's work. He invited Markowitz to spend 1955-56 at the Cowles Foundation, by which time Markowitz had completed the book that was to appear in 1959. Tobin, in a footnote to his article, cites Markowitz's forthcoming book but distinguishes between their aims:* "Markowitz's main interest is prescription of rules of rational behavior for investors; the main concern of this paper is the implications for economic theory... that can be derived from assuming that investors do in fact follow such rules.""9 As Tobin had discerned weaknesses in Keynes's model, he also detects a weakness in Markowitz's model. Markowitz assumes that investors select securities for their portfolios from a universe consisting totally of risky assets. He pays no attention to investors who might control risk by expanding the universe to include cash or other assets of very low risk. His only suggestion for control- ling risk is to diversify the selections from the universe of risky assets. This narrow approach is unnecessary: Investors have a wide range of choice, and most people modulate the riskiness of* The Whole and the Parts their portfolios by holding some share of their wealth in cash, or in cash equivalents like Treasury bills. But Tobin went further. Portfolio selection is not simply a two- asset choice-bonds versus cash, or risk versus no risk. There are always many risky assets to choose from. There is always a spec- trum of interest rates and of assets with varying degrees of risk. There are bonds due in two years and bonds due in thirty years, bonds issued by takeover artists and bonds issued by the govern- ment, stocks that hold the promise of becoming the next Xerox and stocks like AT&T. That is what makes the whole procedure so complicated, and so fascinating. "'10 "The fact that one of the available assets in [Markowitz's] model was riskless turned out to have interesting consequences," Tobin wrote in 1986 after winning the Nobel Prize. The most in- teresting of those consequences led him to place the portfolio- selection problem into a richer setting. And that setting led him to the concept that explains his fame in investment theory: The convenient fact that has just been proved is that the proportionate composition of the non-cash [i.e., risky] assets. is independent of their aggregate share of the investment balance.¹¹ 1 This concept has come to be known as the Separation Theorem, because it argues that the Markowitzian process of selecting secu- rities for the most efficient risky portfolio is completely separate from the decision of how to divide up the total portfolio between risky and risk-free assets. Two levels of decisions are required. The investor's first and most important decision is how much overall exposure to risk is appropriate-how much to hold in risky securities like stocks and how much to hold in more stable assets like bonds and cash. The portfolio's tilt, or asset mix, should be sensitive to considerations of personality, financial cir- cumstances, other sources of capital or income, the nature of the investor's liabilities, and so on. Widows will accept less risk and aggressive business executives will accept more; a pension fund that reinvests its income will be more venturesome than the en- dowment fund of a college that is pressing to make ends meet. It is likely that no two investors will come out at exactly the same degree of risk-aversion. Having determined the appropriate exposure to risk, the inves- 72 t D 2 i i I 2 2 1 i រ 1 2 Į E F t S g i t V C W h m clThe Interior Decorator Fallacy tor's next task is to select the securities that will comprise the risky part of the portfolio. This selection will be made from among the whole universe of risky assets that are available for investment. When combined with some relatively simple mathematics, Tob- in's model enables the investor to identify the single portfolio of risky securities on Markowitz's Efficient. Frontier that dominates all the other possible combinations of efficient portfolios. This will be the portfolio that, among all possible combinations of available risky assets, offers the highest expected return. relative to the risks involved. As this super-efficient portfolio dominates all other portfolios on the Efficient Frontier, the choice should be identical whether the investor is a

widow, an aggressive business executive, or someone in between. The logic of Tobin's Separation Theorem rejects the interior decorator approach and puts a cap of respectability on the intu- itive approach to investing in the puberty boom that I took with the clergyman and his wife. Why settle for less than the best? The Separation Theorem suggests that a manager's zeal for avoiding risk in a widow's portfolio of stocks will lead to disap- pointing results. A portfolio that contains too many supposedly "safe" stocks is badly diversified; its holdings will all decline in price together when some commonly adverse influence strikes them. Even worse, the companies it contains will probably be so conservative that the total portfolio will have too low an ex- pected return to justify the risks of being in the stock market in the first place. The obsession with high expected returns in the executive's stock portfolio produces similar errors. The concentration in companies that are expected to be the next Xerox also defies the elementary principles of diversification. So-called emerging growth company stocks have a habit of moving in and out of fash- ion as a group, and consequently move up and down in price together. From the end of 1983 to the end of 1989, the stocks with the smallest dollar capitalization on the New York Stock Ex- change rose in value by only 50% while those with the largest capitalization soared 167 percent; the prices of the small stocks were more variable to boot. Even though investors may have high hopes when they invest in such companies, the expected return may not be big enough to compensate for the extremely risky character of this undiversified portfolio. 734 The Whole and the Parts If the optimal portfolio identified by Tobin's model happens to be too volatile for the elderly widow, she can keep some of her wealth in savings accounts or in the form of Treasury obligations; then the fluctuations in her total portfolio will be smaller than the fluctuations in the risky assets she holds. If this portfolio is not enterprising enough for the aggressive executive, he can borrow and invest more than 100 percent of his wealth, amplifying the impact of even small fluctuations. Tobin sums up his approach as "the theory of risk-avoiding be- havior." Although his paper is heavy going for a casual reader, it brings abstract ideas into a realistic setting in which both analysis and policymaking can be more effective. It sets Keynesian princi- ples on a firmer footing; it gives portfolio theory broader rele- vance; and it raises portfolio practice to a new level of sophistica- tion and elegance. Tobin makes a wry joke about this accomplishment. His advice has been good enough for presidents of the United States, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Congres- sional Budget Office, and even the City of New Haven, making him, in his words, "in some sense a contributor to finance and portfolio theory." On the other hand, he observes, "I am unique in that no real world financial enterprise has ever asked me for any advice whatsoever."12 Despite the advance that Tobin's innovation made possible, it did nothing to ease the awful chore of those thousands, perhaps millions, of calculations prescribed by Markowitz. Tobin helped the investor to make the strategic choice from the Efficient Fron- tier, but he did nothing to make defining the frontier any easier. Five years were to pass before that problem could be solved. The reverberations from the solution were every bit as great as those from the Separation Theorem.
